/**
 * A2A AgentCard — the seller agent's outward, discoverable identity.
 *
 * Built by `main.ts` and served at `/.well-known/agent-card.json`. When
 * deployed, `main.ts` overwrites `card.url` at boot with the deployed
 * AgentCore runtime URL (`$AGENTCORE_RUNTIME_URL`), so the `url` here is only
 * a local-dev placeholder.
 *
 * The card advertises exactly two skills — `negotiate` and `notify_funded` —
 * and the OAuth2 (Cognito) security scheme buyers must satisfy: AgentCore A2A
 * endpoints require an inbound OAuth2 bearer (there is no anonymous mode).
 * The token URL + scope come from the Cognito user pool
 * `bag deploy provision-cognito` creates (env `OAUTH_TOKEN_URL` /
 * `OAUTH_SCOPE`, injected at deploy); the runtime's inbound JWT authorizer
 * validates the same pool. Locally (no Cognito env) the card omits the scheme
 * so `bag dev` is reachable without a token.
 *
 * You own this file — edit the skill descriptions / card metadata for your
 * seller.
