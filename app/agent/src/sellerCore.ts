/**
 * Seller core — the a2a-free seller logic + background delivery machinery.
 *
 * This is the protocol-neutral heart of the ERC-8183 seller: the two fixed-code
 * operations (`negotiate` → signed quote; `notifyFunded` → verify → ACK →
 * deliver in the background) plus the background-delivery bookkeeping
 * (`isBusy`, the spawn/run/sweep helpers). It imports NOTHING from
 * `@a2a-js/sdk` so it can back any transport — the A2A executor
 * (`executor.ts`) inherits it and wraps it with the a2a wire, and a non-A2A
 * HTTP entrypoint can call it directly without dragging in the a2a sdk.
 *
 *     negotiate    → `signing.signQuote` (rule-based price clamp + EIP-191 sign)
 *     notifyFunded → `signing.verifySignedJob` (fast on-chain gate) → ACK at
 *                    once, then in the BACKGROUND: LLM work → `signing.submitResult`
 *
 * `notifyFunded` is the buyer's "I funded job X — please deliver" notification.
 * Because the work takes time, it does NOT block the caller: it verifies the
 * funded job synchronously (a couple of eth_calls) to ACK accepted/rejected,
 * then runs the slow LLM work + on-chain `submit` in a background task and
 * returns immediately. The buyer reads the deliverable back from the CHAIN
 * (SUBMITTED / `getDeliverableUrl`) — the chain is the source of truth. While
 * any background delivery is in flight {@link SellerCore.isBusy} reports busy,
 * which the transport feeds to AgentCore's `/ping` as `HEALTHY_BUSY` so the
 * scale-to-zero runtime stays warm until the work lands (within the session
 * max-lifetime).
 *
 * ALL signing is FIXED code in `signing.ts` — NEVER an LLM-callable tool
 * (money is never in the LLM; the LLM only produces the work text, via the
 * `runWork` hook). On each notification the core also opportunistically sweeps
 * OTHER funded jobs assigned to this provider — the buyer-push fallback for
 * jobs whose buyer funded on-chain but never sent `notify_funded` (deduped
 * against in-flight jobs). Negotiate stays sweep-free so quotes are fast. A
 * periodic Lambda poller — which also covers the scale-to-zero cold window
 * when no one is invoking — is the v2 robust path.
 *
 * You own this file — specialise the work hook / dispatch, but keep signing
 * OUT of the LLM tool list.
